## Description
The Backend Leashar Project is a robust and scalable backend system designed to support an online learning platform similar to Udemy or Coursera. This project employs Clean Architecture principles alongside Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patterns to ensure a maintainable, testable, and flexible codebase.

## Goals
- **Scalability**: To create a backend system capable of handling a large number of concurrent users and a wide array of courses and content.
- **Maintainability**: By using Clean Architecture and DDD, the codebase is organized into clear, manageable segments, making it easier to update and extend.
- **Separation of Concern**s: Utilizing CQRS to separate read and write operations, optimizing performance and scalability.
- **Testability**: Ensuring that the codebase is thoroughly testable, with unit tests and integration tests covering critical functionalities.

## Key Features
- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, and user profile management.
- **Course Management**: Creation, updating, and deletion of courses and modules.
- **Content Delivery**: Efficient and secure delivery of course materials including videos, documents, and quizzes.
- **Enrollment System**: Managing course enrollments, tracking progress, and providing certificates.
- **Search and Recommendation**: Advanced search and personalized course recommendations.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure processing of payments and management of subscriptions.

## Architecture Overview
- **Clean Architecture**: The project structure follows the Clean Architecture principles, with clearly defined layers for entities, use cases, interface adapters, and infrastructure.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The project uses DDD to model the core business logic, ensuring that the domain is well-represented and easily understandable.
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separates the command (write) and query (read) operations, enhancing the scalability and performance of the system.
